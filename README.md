# Practical-Machine-Learning-Project
This folder contains files for the submittal of my class project for the Coursera Course Practical Machine Learning.
Four files in addition to this readme were uploaded to this GitHub repository.

You should find the following
1.) A R-markdown file (Project2.Rmd) which is the R markdown file that created the subsequent markdown file and HTML documents.
2.) The markdown file (Project2.md) which was created by the R markdown file.
3.) HTML output from the markdown output, and 
4.) A folder containing the plot for paper.
